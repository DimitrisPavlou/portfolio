# System Identification and Adaptive Control Suite

This repository contains a three-part project focused on the modeling, estimation, and robust control of dynamic systems. The work progresses from offline statistical analysis to real-time adaptive architectures designed to handle uncertainty and disturbances.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical system modeling and practical control implementation. It is divided into three core modules:

1.  **Offline Estimation:** Statistical parameter identification.
2.  **Online Estimation:** Real-time tracking using Lyapunov-based topologies.
3.  **Robust Adaptive Control:** Advanced MRAC with leakage modifications.

## 📂 Project Modules

### Part 1: Offline Parameter Estimation
Focused on identifying the constant parameters of a system using batch input-output data.
* **Methodology:** Least Squares (LS) Estimation.
* **Key Learning:** Implementation of the Normal Equations to minimize the sum of squared residuals and verifying the "Persistence of Excitation" condition.

### Part 2: Online Parameter Estimation
Transitioned to recursive estimation for real-time applications where parameters may be time-varying.
* **Algorithms:** Gradient Descent-based estimation laws.
* **Topologies:** * **Parallel:** The model runs independently of the plant.
    * **Series-Parallel:** Uses plant state feedback within the estimation model to improve convergence speed and stability.
* **Stability Analysis:** Design of estimation laws based on Lyapunov stability theory to ensure that the tracking error $e(t) \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$.

### Part 3: Robust Adaptive Control
Development of a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) system engineered to remain stable in the presence of bounded disturbances and unmodeled dynamics.
* **Controller Design:** Adaptive laws for plant tracking.
* **Robustness Modifications:**
    * **$\sigma$-modification:** Introduced a leakage term to the adaptive law to prevent "parameter drift" during periods of low excitation.
    * **$\epsilon$-modification:** An adaptive leakage variation where the damping term is scaled by the magnitude of the tracking error.
