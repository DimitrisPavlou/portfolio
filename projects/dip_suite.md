## 🧮 Implemented Algorithms

1. **Harris Corner Detection**  
   - Detects interest points (corners) in an image  
   - Useful for feature matching, motion tracking, and object recognition  

2. **Hough Transform for Line Detection**  
   - Identifies straight lines in an image  
   - Commonly applied in edge detection and shape analysis  

3. **Image Rotation**  
   - Rotates an image by a specified angle while preserving geometry  
   - Demonstrates geometric transformation techniques  

4. **Histogram Equalization**  
   - Enhances image contrast through intensity redistribution  
   - Includes:
     - **Global Histogram Equalization**
     - **Adaptive Histogram Equalization**

5. **Image Filtering**  
   - Implements frequency-domain restoration techniques  
   - Includes:
